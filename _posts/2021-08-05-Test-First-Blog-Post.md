## Creating a blog on Github using Jekyll
This is a test of the blog-making capabilities of GitHub.

I plan to use this to document all the code that I've written over the last year. This will include my scraping stuff, machine learning, and natural language processing. Eventually, I hope to be able to do some keras and tensorflow. For now, I just want to get used to Github, and make sure that I know how to make a nice looking website.
