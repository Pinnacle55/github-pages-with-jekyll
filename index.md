I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about lots of Python things.
I want to test things about *italics* and __bolded__ stuff.

I eventually want to upload

things | description
-------|------------
code | python
pictures | examples

It will basically be a record of all the things I've done so that I can go back to it at a later date.
